b.It is easy to insert and delete elements in Linked List
c.Random access is not allowed in a typical implementation of Linked Lists

Q4. List concatenation
The concatenation of two list can performed in O(1) time. Which of the following variation of linked list can be used?

a.Singly linked list
b.Doubly linked list
c.Circular doubly linked list
d.Array implementation of list

Ans-c
Explanation:8

You can easily concatenate two lists in O(1) time using either a single linked list or a doubly linked list, provided that 
you have a pointer to the last node in at least one of the lists. (And, of course, pointers to the list heads.)
You can't do it with an array implementation, because you end up having to allocate more memory and copy the new resulting list to it.
Even if the array already has memory allocated, you still have to copy all of the new items to it. So it's either O(m+n) or O(n)
(where m and n are the lengths of the individual lists, respectively).
With a circularly linked list, you can easily concatenate them in O(1) time. It's just a matter of breaking a link in both
lists, and then hooking them together. This assumes, of course, that the order of items isn't especially important.

Q5. Sort a list
Which of the following sorting algorithms can be used to sort a random linked list with minimum time complexity?

a.insertion sort
b.merge sort
c.quick sort
d.heap sort

Ans-b

Q6. Solve for Linked List
Predict the output that the following code gives for a linked list given as 1->2->3->4->5->6
cpp

void fun(node* start)                                                        
{
    if(start == NULL)
    return;
    cout<<start->data<<" "; 
    if(start->next != NULL )
    fun(start->next->next);
    cout<<start->data<<" "; 
}

a.1 4 6 6 4 1
b.1 3 5 1 3 5
c.1 2 3 5
d.1 3 5 5 3 1
Ans-d

Q7. Skip List
Skip lists are similar to which of the following data structure? Read about Skip list from here
a.Stack
b.Heap
c.BST
d.Balanced BST
Ans-d

Q8. Memory Efficient List
What is a memory efficient double linked list?

a.Each node has only one pointer to traverse the list back and forth
b.The list has breakpoints for faster traversal
c.An auxiliary singly linked list acts as a helper list to traverse through the doubly linked list
d.None
ans-a

Q9. Solve for Linked List 2
Predict the modified doubly linked list of the following code for the given doubly linked list as 1<--> 2 <--> 3 <--> 4 <--> 5 <-->6
CPP

void fun(node **head_ref)
{
    node *temp = NULL;
    node *current = *head_ref;

    while (current !=  NULL)
    {
        temp = current->prev;
        current->prev = current->next;
        current->next = temp;
        current = current->prev;
    }

    if(temp != NULL )
        *head_ref = temp->prev;
}

a.2 <--> 1 <--> 4 <--> 3 <--> 6 <-->5
b.5 <--> 4 <--> 3 <--> 2 <--> 1 <-->6
c.6 <--> 5 <--> 4 <--> 3 <--> 2 <--> 1
d.6 <--> 5 <--> 4 <--> 3 <--> 1 <--> 2
Ans-c
