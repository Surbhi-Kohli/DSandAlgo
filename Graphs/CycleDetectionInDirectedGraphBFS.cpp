/*
Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph using BFS
Given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains a cycle or not. Your function should return true 
if the given graph contains at least one cycle, else return false. For example, the following graph contains
two cycles 0->1->2->3->0 and 2->4->2, so your function must return true.
The idea is to simply use Kahnâ€™s algorithm for Topological Sorting

Steps involved in detecting cycle in a directed graph using BFS.

Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the graph and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.

Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)

Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.

Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.
Step 4: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.

Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph has cycle, otherwise not.
