In this article we will see another way to find the linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
The approach is based on the below fact :

A DAG G has at least one vertex with in-degree 0 and one vertex with out-degree 0.
Proof: Thereâ€™s a simple proof to the above fact is that a DAG does not contain a cycle which 
means that all paths will be of finite length. Now let S be the longest path 
from u(source) to v(destination). Since S is the longest path there can be no incoming edge to u 
and no outgoing edge from v, if this situation had occurred then S would not have been the longest path
=> indegree(u) = 0 and outdegree(v) = 0

Algorithm:
Steps involved in finding the topological ordering of a DAG:

Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in 
         the DAG and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.

Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)

Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.

     a.Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
     b.Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
     c.If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.
Step 4: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.
Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph then 
        the topological sort is not possible for the given graph.

How to find in-degree of each node?
There are 2 ways to calculate in-degree of every vertex:
Take an in-degree array which will keep track of
1) Traverse the array of edges and simply increase the counter of the destination node by 1.

for each node in Nodes
    indegree[node] = 0;
for each edge(src,dest) in Edges
    indegree[dest]++
Time Complexity: O(V+E)

2) Traverse the list for every node and then increment the in-degree of all the nodes connected to it by 1.

    for each node in Nodes
        If (list[node].size()!=0) then
        for each dest in list
            indegree[dest]++;

Time Complexity: The outer for loop will be executed V number of times and the inner for loop will 
                  be executed E number of times, Thus overall time complexity is O(V+E).

The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(V+E)
