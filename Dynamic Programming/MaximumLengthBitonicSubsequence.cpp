/*
Given an array arr[0 â€¦ n-1] containing n positive integers, a subsequence of arr[] is called Bitonic 
if it is first increasing, then decreasing. Write a function that takes an array as argument and returns
the length of the longest bitonic subsequence.

A sequence, sorted in increasing order is considered Bitonic with the decreasing part as empty. Similarly,
decreasing order sequence is considered Bitonic with the increasing part as empty.

You are provided n numbers of array. You need to find the maximum length of biotonic subsequence.
A subsequence is biotonic if it is first strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing or entirely strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
Examples:

Input arr[] = {1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1};
Output: 6 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 6 is 1, 2, 10, 4, 2, 1)

Input arr[] = {12, 11, 40, 5, 3, 1}
Output: 5 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 5 is 12, 11, 5, 3, 1)

Input arr[] = {80, 60, 30, 40, 20, 10}
Output: 5 (A Longest Bitonic Subsequence of length 5 is 80, 60, 30, 20, 10)

Input Format
First line contains integer t which is number of test case.
For each test case, in the first line you are given an integer n which is the size of array and 
the next line contains n space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Constraints
1<=t<=100
1<=n<=1000
| Ai | <= 10000

Output Format
Print the maximum length of biotonic subsequence for each testcase in a new line.

Sample Input
2
8
1 11 2 10 4 5 2 1
6
80 60 30 40 20 10
Sample Output
6
5
Explanation
For 1st test case : Maximum length = 1, 2, 4, 5, 2, 1
For 2nd test case : Maximum length = 80, 60, 40, 20 10 or 80, 60, 30, 20 10
